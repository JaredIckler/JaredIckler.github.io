# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

This artifact is from the course CS-350 and was completed originally at the end of August 2024.  The artifact interfaces with a microcontroller from Texas Instruments to make an LED on the board flash the morse code for SOS. 

This artifact was chosen as it is a unique project among the courses through this program, as well as being a good example of basics such as commenting, the use of functions, etc.  This artifact expanded on the existing functionality by both expanding the amount of words that the LED can flash as well as utilizing the buttons on the board to cycle through the options.  The original project was a simple application to allow for the students to get used to the LED controlling functions.  The enhancement expanded this functionality by adding other basic morse code words like ok, yes, and no, as well as allowing the user to cycle through them.  While this functionality is essentially a proof of concept when used with the provided board, a little tweaking would allow for this code to be used to interface with a much larger piece of technology and actually allow for basic communication in an emergency situation. 

I feel that I have accomplished course objectives that I set out to complete with this artifact.  I improved the functionality of the base code to expand upon the messages that can be sent, as well as developing a way to cycle through the provided messages.  I do not currently have plans to update my outcome-coverage plans.

This artifact is very unique from the other projects that I have had to do in this program, and as such even the original artifact taught me alot.  CS-350 is the only  Computer Science class that I took that actually displayed a real life tangible product with the projects that it had the student complete.  Other classes had the students set up websites or databases, or even develop apps, but this was the only one where the end product was something physical.  It really showed that the field of Computer Science is not limited to just the virtual space and it can have effects on the real world in certain settings.  The enhancements allowed me to appreciate adding and expanding on a simple project in order to make it more realistically useful.
